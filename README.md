# operating-systems
this is a shell done as homework for the operating systems subject

the different folders represent different submissions:
  - 0 base shell (info, inner workings, historic list ... )
  - 1 filesystem (create, erase ... )
  - 2 memory (malloc, dealloc, map ...)
  - 3 process (fork, uids ... )

each version is built upon the previous one
the base shell however, was rewritten on memory shell, since several problems were found
